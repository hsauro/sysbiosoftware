iBioSim
=======

iBioSim is a computer-aided design (CAD) tool aimed at the modeling, analysis, and design of genetic circuits. While iBioSim primarily targets models of genetic circuits, models representing metabolic networks, cell-signaling pathways, and other biological and chemical systems can also be analyzed. The software runs on all major platforms, Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.


Capabilities
------------

* Deterministic time-course simulation

* Stochastic time-course simulation

* Flux balance analysis

* Support for SED-ML

* Import and export of standard SBML to Level 3 Version 1

* Import and export of standard Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL)

Applications
============

The tool has been used in a number of research projects:

* Engineering production of resveratrol in E. coli (Computational Metabolic Model for Engineered Production of Resveratrol in Escherichia coli, ACS Synthetic Biology, 20 August 2021, volume=10 (8), p1992–2001 doi=10.1021/acssynbio.1c00163)

* Part of a general workflow for the design, implementation and testing of synthetic genetic circuits (Toward Full-Stack In Silico Synthetic Biology: Integrating Model Specification, Simulation, Verification, and Biological Compilation, ACS Synthetic Biology, 20 August 2021, 10 (8), p1931–1945 

Notability
==========

iBioSim is one of the few tools that focuses on the simulation and design of genetic regulatory circuits (Genetic Circuit Design Principles,Handbook of Cell Biosensors, 2022, p339–381, doi=10.1007/978-3-030-23217-7_171) As such, the tool is more actively used in the synthetic biology community. It uses a visual GUI environment that allows users to `draw' genetic networks on screen.
