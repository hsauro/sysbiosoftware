iBioSim
=======

iBioSim is a computer-aided design (CAD) tool aimed at the modeling, analysis, and design of genetic circuits. While iBioSim primarily targets models of genetic circuits, models representing metabolic networks, cell-signaling pathways, and other biological and chemical systems can also be analyzed. The software runs on all major platforms, Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
